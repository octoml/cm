It is becoming very challenging to co-design, optimize and deploy efficient AI Systems in the real world:
["MLOps Is a Mess But That's to be Expected"](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/mlops-is-a-mess).

However, [our experience](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/ck2/docs/motivation.md) 
suggests that it is possible to [apply DevOps principles to MLOps](https://www.datanami.com/2022/03/30/birds-arent-real-and-neither-is-mlops/)
if we treat all AI, ML and Systems artifacts including models, data sets, frameworks, libraries and scripts as "code" meta packages 
with dependencies on other artifacts, operating systems and hardware.

We are prototyping [CM-based components](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/ck2) 
to bridge the gap between MLOps and DevOps, modularize AI and ML systems, 
and automate their co-design, benchmarking, optimization and deployment 
across very diverse and continuously changing software and hardware stacks.
